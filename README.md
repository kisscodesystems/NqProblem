# NqProblem
Extended 9 in 1 solution for the good old N Queens problem. Completion problem is also done.

  We  give  a  solution  which   considers  the  problem  from  a  whole
  different   aspect  and  splits the  actual  calculation from the real
  rules  of the chess  game. In this way, the calculations  of rooks and
  bishops are also available as well as their super or awesome versions.
 (super means that the pieces can also attack as a knight and awesome means the above but till the edge of the chessborad)
  Preplaced chess pieces are also available to solve N Queens
  Completion problem.
  
  Note: the board in size N is an ordered sequence between 0 and N^2 - 1
